# Debian-Gkuba

This is my customization for fresh Debian installs.

### Download Debian non-free netinstall

Use the following Debian ISO as the base <https://cdimage.debian.org/cdimage/unofficial/non-free/cd-including-firmware/weekly-builds/amd64/iso-cd/>

*do NOT grab the EDU download and this includes non-free and firmware*
### Base Stuff - Root

_Run as ROOT_
```bash
sudo su
./root.sh
```

### Theme Stuff - User Level
 ```bash
 ./user.sh
 ```
