# Debian-Gkuba

This is my customization for fresh Debian installs.

## Download Debian non-free netinstall

Use the following Debian ISO as the base <https://cdimage.debian.org/cdimage/unofficial/non-free/cd-including-firmware/weekly-builds/amd64/iso-cd/>

do **NOT** grab the **EDU** download and this includes non-free and firmware

### Base Stuff - Root

```bash
bash <(wget -qO- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gkuba/Debian-Gkuba/main/install.sh)
```
